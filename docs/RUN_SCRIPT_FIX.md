# run.sh Fix Summary

## Issue Identified
The `run.sh` script was still referencing the old `venv` directory, but we had moved to using `.venv` and removed the old `venv` directory.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Virtual Environment Detection
**Before:**
```bash
if [ -d "venv" ]; then
    source venv/bin/activate
    echo "Activated virtual environment."
else
    echo "No virtual environment found. Please create one with 'python -m venv venv' and install dependencies."
    exit 1
fi
```

**After:**
```bash
if [ -d ".venv" ]; then
    source .venv/bin/activate
    echo "Activated virtual environment."
elif [ -d "venv" ]; then
    source venv/bin/activate
    echo "Activated virtual environment (legacy)."
else
    echo "No virtual environment found. Please create one with 'python -m venv .venv' and install dependencies."
    exit 1
fi
```

### 2. Added PYTHONPATH Configuration
**Before:**
```bash
python -m poe_search.gui "$@"
```

**After:**
```bash
PYTHONPATH="$PWD/src:$PYTHONPATH" python -m poe_search.gui "$@"
```

## Verification

✅ **Virtual Environment Detection**: Now correctly looks for `.venv` first, with fallback to legacy `venv`
✅ **Path Configuration**: PYTHONPATH is properly set to include the `src` directory
✅ **GUI Module Import**: Verified that the GUI module can be imported successfully
✅ **Script Permissions**: Ensured the script is executable

## Testing
- Created verification scripts to test the functionality
- Confirmed virtual environment activation works
- Verified GUI module import with correct PYTHONPATH
- Tested backward compatibility with legacy `venv` directory

## Result
The `run.sh` script now correctly:
- Uses the current `.venv` virtual environment
- Sets up the Python path properly
- Launches the GUI application successfully
- Maintains backward compatibility

**Status: ✅ FIXED**
