## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it to us as described below.

### How to Report

**Please DO NOT create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.**

Instead, please report security vulnerabilities via one of the following methods:

1. **Email**: Send an email to [security@poe-search.dev](mailto:security@poe-search.dev)
2. **Private Issue**: Create a private security advisory on GitHub (if you have access)
3. **Direct Message**: Contact maintainers directly through GitHub

### What to Include

When reporting a vulnerability, please include:

- **Description**: A clear description of the vulnerability
- **Steps to Reproduce**: Detailed steps to reproduce the issue
- **Impact**: Potential impact of the vulnerability
- **Environment**: Operating system, Python version, and any relevant details
- **Proof of Concept**: If possible, include a proof of concept
- **Suggested Fix**: If you have suggestions for fixing the issue

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 24 hours
- **Assessment**: Within 3-5 business days
- **Fix Development**: Depends on complexity (typically 1-4 weeks)
- **Public Disclosure**: After fix is available and tested

### Responsible Disclosure

We follow responsible disclosure practices:

1. **Private Reporting**: Vulnerabilities are reported privately
2. **Assessment**: We assess the severity and impact
3. **Fix Development**: We develop and test fixes
4. **Coordination**: We coordinate with reporters on disclosure
5. **Public Disclosure**: We publicly disclose after fixes are available
