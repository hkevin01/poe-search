# Poe Search Project - Cursor AI Rules

## ðŸš« ABSOLUTE PROHIBITIONS

### NEVER create fake/dummy/sample/mock data
- No placeholder conversations, users, or content
- No "sample data for testing" - use real Poe.com conversation data only
- No mock API responses - work with actual Poe.com API
- No fabricated conversation titles or messages

## âœ… REQUIRED PRACTICES

### Real Data Only
- Use actual conversations from `data/poe_search.db` (4 real conversations exist)
- Work with real Poe.com conversation titles: "Python Web Development Discussion", "JavaScript React Tutorial", etc.
- Debug against actual database content, not assumptions
- Verify file paths and database connections with real data

### Current Issue Focus
- GUI SearchWidget displays 0 conversations despite database having 4 real ones
- MainWindow database logs missing - investigate Database object connection
- Fix real path/connection issues, don't work around with fake data

### Authentication
- Use real Poe.com tokens and browser session extraction
- Handle actual Poe-Formkey validation
- Work with real GraphQL API endpoints

### Error Handling
- Log actual file paths, database states, and connection results
- Use specific error messages for real debugging scenarios
- Verify what actually exists vs. what's expected

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Context

This is a PyQt6 GUI application for searching real Poe.com conversations. The SearchWidget should display actual conversation data from the SQLite database, but currently shows empty results despite the database containing 4 real conversations from 2025-07-03.

**Focus**: Debug the database connection issue causing SearchWidget to receive 0 conversations instead of creating any workarounds or test data.
